# simple_photo_joiner
a simple tool to join some photos

# How to use it

- clone your photos into folder `images`

  - better make sure that **each photo are the same size** cause this is a very dummy joiner...
  - better make sure that **photos are arranged** well as you wish (You can just name them by numbers)

- run `joiner.py`

- get `result.jpg`, and enjoy :)
